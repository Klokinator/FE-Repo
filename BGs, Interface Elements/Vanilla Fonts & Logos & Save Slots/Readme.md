Over the years, I've needed to reference the Fire Emblem logos time and time again. However, as time has gone on, I've found that it's become a lot harder to find the fonts used in some of the older games, and cleaned up logos from the older gamesthat aren't JPEG'd to hell.

I decided to add this folder for fun and cool fonts relating to Fire Emblem.

You can find references to these fonts on the Wiki page here: https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_fonts_used_in_Fire_Emblem_logos

However, that page is incomplete and offers no downloads for these logos with the background elements taken out, so I'll be collecting more of them moving forward so we have a long-term preservation platform for them.

Besides. It's not like fonts take up much space anyway. Might as well add them to the Repo!
